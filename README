# QUESTION:
# if every family wants to have boys
# they will have children until they have a boy
# what percent of population will be boys?

control.py: 
	just does a 50/50 guess and allows each family to only have 1 baby.
	this is used to check the standard deviation of your random device


simple_baby.py:
	runs through X number of families
	each family is allowed Y attempts to have a child before they hit the max number of children allowed
	shows a histogram of families by size
	percent population of boys vs. girls


mom_multi_gen.py:
	same as simple_baby.py, but breeds for multiple generations to see if there is a 
	generational drift


correct_gens.py:
	sample as mom_multi_gen.py, but the family doesn't care of they have boys or girls.
	they have as many kids as max allows
	this shows population growth, where as mom_multi shows population collapse
